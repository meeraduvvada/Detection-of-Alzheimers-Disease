# Detection-of-Alzheimers-Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes progressive cognitive decline, with one in 85 expected to be affected by 2050. Early detection is crucial but challenging. Deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), enhances AD diagnosis through MRI analysis, leveraging advances in computational technology for more accurate results.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive form of dementia that leads to neurological impairments, mental deterioration, and cognitive decline. The incidence of AD is expected to affect one in 85 individuals globally by 2050. Early detection is critical for effective treatment, yet diagnosing AD early remains challenging. As many AD patients experience loss of speech function, neuropsychological assessments are typically used for early detection. The accuracy of these Cognitive Psychological Tests depends heavily on the clinician's expertise. There is a need to develop an automated detection and classification model for AD. Longitudinal monitoring of brain changes through continuous MRI is crucial for accurately tracking disease progression. The integration of deep learning has provided significant insights and enhanced the accuracy of clinical outcomes by enabling the analysis and classification of distinctive features useful for diagnosing AD. Advances in computational technology have boosted the capabilities of deep learning algorithms, particularly in computer vision and neuroimaging analysis. This progress has opened up new possibilities for using deep learning-based approaches to identify and predict neurological disorders from MRI scans. Among the deep learning algorithms, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach is predominantly utilized to analyze neurological conditions from MRI data.
